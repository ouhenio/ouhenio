### Hello! My name is Eugenio. 🐦


I'm a ML Engineer working at the Chilean National Center of Artificial Intelligence (CENIA).

I love designing and building end-to-end ML systems, working on deep generative models, and contributing to the open source community.

I'm currently developing Spanish versions of foundational models ([CLIP](https://github.com/OpenCENIA/themo), Stable Diffusion and GPT). 😊
