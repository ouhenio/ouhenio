I'm a Tech Lead in Machine Learning Engineering at the Chilean National Center for Artificial Intelligence (CENIA), where I supervise the development of ML solutions for Chilean companies and the state.

I love designing and building end-to-end ML systems, aiding in the research and development of deep generative models, and contributing to the open source community.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, practicing creative coding, implementing papers that lack publicly available code, doing yoga, and going for a swim.
