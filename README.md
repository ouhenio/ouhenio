### Hi there 👋

---

I'm a ML Engineer working at the Chilean National Center of Artificial Intelligence (CENIA).

I enjoy designing and building end-to-end ML systems, working on Deep Generative Models, and building _pretty_ stuff.

I'm currently building spanish versions of multimodal, generative and large language models (CLIP, Stable Diffusion and GPT). 😊
