I'm a Lead Machine Learning Engineer at the Chilean National Center for Artificial Intelligence (CENIA), where I've been working with foundational models such as [CLIP](https://github.com/OpenCENIA/themo), Stable Diffusion, and currently ViTs and GPTs.

I love designing and building end-to-end ML systems, aiding in the research and development of deep generative models, and contributing to the open source community.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, practicing creative coding, implementing papers that lack publicly available code, doing yoga, and going for a swim.
