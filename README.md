### Hola! 🌱


I'm a ML Engineer working at the Chilean National Center of Artificial Intelligence (CENIA), currently developing Spanish versions of foundational models ([CLIP](https://github.com/OpenCENIA/themo), Stable Diffusion and GPT). 🐦

I love designing and building end-to-end ML systems, aiding in the research and development of deep generative models, and contributing to the open source community.

In my free time, I enjoy reading books, practicing [creative coding](https://www.instagram.com/ouhenio/), and learning new stuff (I currently got into bouldering and guitar).

I'm very passionate about generative models, so I try to keep up to date with the state of the art, both in literature and in code. Some of my open-source work has been featured in [Yanick Kilcher's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3cmxn5znyU), [Deep Learning Weekly](https://www.deeplearningweekly.com/p/deep-learning-weekly-issue-233), and [Ahsen Kaliq's twitter](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1490201823139016710).
