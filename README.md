### Hi! üå±üê¶

I'm an ML Engineer at the Chilean National Center of Artificial Intelligence (CENIA), where I've been working with foundational models such as [CLIP](https://github.com/OpenCENIA/themo), Stable Diffusion and currently GPT.

I love designing and building end-to-end ML systems, aiding in the research and development of deep generative models, and contributing to the open source community. My open-source work has been featured on [Yanick Kilcher's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3cmxn5znyU), [Deep Learning Weekly](https://www.deeplearningweekly.com/p/deep-learning-weekly-issue-233), and [Ahsen Kaliq's twitter](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1490201823139016710).

In my free time, I enjoy reading, practicing [creative coding](https://www.instagram.com/ouhenio/), and exploring new hobbies (I currently got into yoga and swimming).
